# ORAN64CASE

Quick install --

Start you ORA.. SSH or F4 to command line as pigaming. do not create any directory to download it to.. just download it straight off. It's just a dirty script to install it.. no safe guards.. at your own risk be it.

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kegg1701/ORAN64CASE/master/case_install.sh

chmod +x case_install.sh && ./case_install.sh

this does a quick repo update.. installs fbset, and updates ffmpeg and mali-fbdev to be on the safe side.
when it comes up asking you what to do, just hit the return key for default option.
once installed the N64 logo will appear and you're good to go.

enjoy.
