After walking away from the ORA guys, never actually wanted to work with them, just wanted to give them a different approach to the problem, I now want to continue my own developement research for the N64 tft case from Hard Kernel.

What makes me laugh is that I'm no coder or expert basher, have a lot experience scripting for CG packages, python and some C when it comes to the likes of Unity, and I solved their issue in just a few hours so the screen worked on the current kernel ORA uses.. So when they finally release ORA 1.5 what you'll see is what I originally did.. I hope they change a lot of it becauses structure wise it's basic.. simple yet effective to their needs.

If they were on the most recent kernel, agian not one of them can solve the controller issues and bluetooth problem, half of things  implemented would not be needed, including the use of FBSET which will cause them issues.. but that aint my problem in the slightest.
