A different approach to the N64 TFT problem, I now want to continue my own developement research for the N64 tft case from Hard Kernel.

What makes me laugh is that I'm no coder or even a high level basher,Im a CG Artist and industry animator by trade, but have a lot experience scripting for CG packages, python and C when it comes to the likes of Unity,Maya, Max, LW even Blender and I solved their issue in just a few hours so the screen worked on the current kernel ORA uses.. So when they finally release ORA 1.5 what you'll see is what I originally did.. I hope they change a lot of it becauses structure wise it's basic.. simple yet effective to their needs.

If THERA were on the most recent kernel, half of things implemented would not be needed, including the use of FBSET which will cause issues.. but that aint my problem in the slightest.
